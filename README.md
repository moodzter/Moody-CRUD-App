# Moody-CRUD-App

Developed a functioning app where you can post suggestions for art pieces that we should sell on the website, most of them are generically famous. The suggestions page works and it has all 7 restful routes, however I wasn't able to get the cart and browse pages working in time, however I do plan on going back and finishing those. 

Even though it isn't finalized yet, to make it work I used two schemas and made a ton of routes. I added img's to the schemas, and it was easy because the url is really just a string, it doesn't need a unique parameter. 

On this project my biggest enemy was procrasination. I could've made this much better if I had use all of my alotted time however I didn't, and I regret it because when I did start putting in the work I really enjoyed it, however getting to that point was the hard part. 

I want to get better at being able to make this without looking at previous notes. I feel like I could probably do it now, after this project, but I really think I depended on my notes from previous lessons and homeworks a little too much. 

All in all the app uses all 7 restful routes, and it looks cleaned up with some css. There are 3 functioning pages, the home page, suggestions page, and links page. I plan on making the browse and cart page work soon, however with the product I have now it does meet MVP, however I do wish I pushed above and beyond to do more, and I am excited to continue with this project and make it better than it is now.
